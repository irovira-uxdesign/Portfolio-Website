        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Fit.square is a responsive Health & Fitness Web Application that provides
          personalised fitness plans and coaching support to help users follow a healthy
          lifestyle and improve their wellness. </p>
      </div>
      <h2>The Challenge. To design a digital product to change user behaviour in heath and lifestyle</h2>
      <p> This project has been realised as part of the Career Foundry UX Immersion
        Course. </p>
      <p>The challenge was to apply the entire UX design process to create a web
        application. It should be noted that I did not have any UX experience before
        starting this project. My high-level goals were to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design a responsive Web application that enables users to create a
          Fitness plan and contact fitness experts in training and nutrition.</li>
        <li>Create a High-fidelity prototype that allows us to test and validate the
          design with potential users.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>The business strategy was to create a competitive fitness and nutrition
          application that enables users to contact experts to customise their own
          workout and nutrition plans, having the ability to gain a considerable market
          share.</p>

        <h3>Problem Statement. Which problems are we facing?</h3>
        <p>By doing initial research of my competitors, I discovered a list of possible
          problems that helped me to craft my problem statement.</p>
        <p>Our users need a way to schedule, and tailor their own meals plans & workouts
          routines because they want to follow a healthy lifestyle and improve their
          wellness. </p>
        <p>We will know this to be true when we see how many users are using the product
          to prepare their meal plans and workout routines.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Dicover</h2>

          <h3>Competitive Analysis. Getting insights from our competitors in the field </h3>
          <p>The next step will be to identify potential competitors in order to identify
            opportunities and risks in the market. I conducted an analysis of two of my
            competitors, Asana Rebel and 8fit. Both products offer users training and meal
            plans.</p>

          </div>
          <p>In conclusion, it is possible to launch a competitive web application that offers
            personalised fitness and nutrition plans created by experts. The key will be to
            design a personalised user experience aimed to connect with experts in fitness
            and nutrition. </p>

          <h3>User Research. Getting user insights</h3>
          <p>User interview is a core method of user research. That is why I chose to
            interview 6 people from our target audience.</p>
          <p>The interviews took approximately 30 minutes. This was the most relevant
            information for decision-making in creating the solution.</p>

          <h2>Analysis</h2>
          <div>
            <h3>Personas. Building Empathy to define the users</h3>
            <p>Using the insights from interviews and survey results, I defined three personas
              to better empathise with my target groups and prioritise goals according to their
              needs.</p>
            <div>
              <picture>
                <source srcset="img/Fit.square/Fitsquare_Personas@1x.png" width="600" media="(max-width:767px)">
                <img src="img/Fit.square/Fitsquare_Personas@2x.png" width="1200" alt="Personas">
              </picture>
            </div>
            <div>
              <picture>
                <source srcset="img/Fit.square/Fitsquare_Persona 01@1x.png" width="600" media="(max-width:767px)">
                <img src="img/Fit.square/Fitsquare_Persona 01@2x.png" width="1200" alt="Persona 01">
              </picture>
            </div>

            <p>After defining the different personas I created a user journey for each one. Then,
              I realised that the selected workflows were related to the three personas. That is
              why I chose one of the personas, Alice, for the next steps of the design process.</p>
            <p>The user journey shows the different steps of the scenario in which Alice is
              working to achieve her goals. The objective is to discover possible opportunities
              for interactions with the product.</p>

            <h3>User stories. Translating user needs into features</h3>
            <p>After analysing the insights from creating personas and user journeys, I was able
              to create a list of possible features for my product. The next step was to
              translate those features into user stories. This methodology allowed me to distill
              the user needs and the business requirements down to small, readable, and
              executable parts.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>User flows. Defining user interactions to complete tasks</h3>
              <p>From the user stories I have a bunch of goals that users want to achieve when
                approaching the product. The following feature flowcharts describe the user
                flow through the Web application, listing potential features users may
                interact with. Rather than a list of screens or pages, user flows have a
                beginning and an end.</p>

                  <p>By now I have already gathered enough information to get started with the
                    wireframes. I created this set of low-fidelity wireframes of all of the key screens
                    needed to complete the main user tasks that I will be testing for: creating a
                    fitness plan, booking a call with a coach, and starting a workout session.</p>

                    were created to test the idea with users and fix the problems in the early stage.</p>

                    in some formulations and interactions. In addition, the users asked smart
                    questions, which led to further improvements.</p>

                      prototype, I was able to focus on the UI design for the project. I did an
                      effort to revise and boost the visual elements of the mobile version of the

                      <p>The Fit.square design reflects the energy and excitement of fitness, using a bold
                        aesthetic that expresses engagement and achievement. Its UI contains shapes
                        that invite the user to personalise them with their progress. Its copywriting
                        speaks with a friendly, can-do tone of voice.</p>

                        <p>Roboto is the cornerstone element of the product’s visual language. It has a
                          mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time
                          featuring friendly and open curves.</p>
                        <p>Strategically selecting the colours for our product will allow us to create the

                          recognisable consistency to the product.</p>

                        <p>Illustrations can communicate personality, delighting user goals, or make UI
                          more informative. I adapted the illustrations from unDraw. The illustrations’
                          colours were adapted to the brand’s universe, using variations of orange, green,
                          and yellow as main colours.</p>

                        <h4>Lessons learned</h4>
                        <p>The challenge of the project was to design a product that could have an impact
                          on user behaviour in health & lifestyle. From the discovery stage, I understood
                          that lack of motivation was one of the main points that stop users from
                          exercising. The product should attract new users and engage them to follow a
                          fitness plan over time.</p>
                        <p>The most challenging part of the project was to create an intuitive, simple, and
                          clear user interface that is able to host all the features of the product. I would
                          point out the following lessons learned.</p>
